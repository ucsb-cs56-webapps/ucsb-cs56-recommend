F18 Final Remarks:
- Spotify API Java wrapper javadocs can be a little tedious to learn.
- Some variable names will not make sense because tutorials from the internet were used. You will probably understand what the variables are by context.
- If you're actually interested in web dev outside of class, we recommend learning Javascript and using Node.js as a backend technology instead.
- We used MySQL & ClearDB for the database but if you want, MongoDB is an easier database to learn if you're a beginner. MySQL vs. NoSQL (MongoDB) databases have their own advantages/disadvantages.
- Features to be added:
	- Add recommendations for other forms of entertainment, like TV shows, books (original intent of project)
	- Better algorithm of recommending songs
	- View playlists of other users (possibly recommend songs through comparison of other users' playlists)
